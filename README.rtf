Here you will find files to recreate the multicompartmental and reduced model
simulations in the paper. In order to run the multicompartmental simulations,
there is .bat file which runs many runs of NEURON to simulate inputs
into the tuft and basal dendrites. The file is batch_run_numsyn.bat

If you look into that file you will see that it loops through numbers of CS+
synapses and then repeats. Depending on your computer, you will probably have
to change the number of parallel replicates to run (e.g. decrease %%R and 
increase %%X), so that your computer doesn't freeze. All together, the simulations
take me multiple days of compute time to run on a pretty impressive computer.

The batch file calls python files: python batch_py_numsyn_basal.py and
python batch_py_numsyn_tuft.py which each take an input of how many CS+ synapses
to run in the simulation.

There are another few .bat files for current injections of different types:
current_steps.bat, onlybackground.bat, and current_steps_singleAP.bat, each with
their own python files.

All of these .bat files produce a lot of datafiles, with the extension .p

To analyze the data, there is an ipython nobetbook: fearful_dendrites.ipynb
All the imported libraries need to be installed, and the working directory will
need to be changed to the folder with all the data.
